				student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
				did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
				project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
				could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
				experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
				100% recommend! ”
